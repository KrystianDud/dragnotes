# Drag Notes App
This app will allow you to create draggable notes.

User is able to create up to ten custom notes, assign their position and change their colours to distinguish specific type or group of notes.

User can change the notes colour, drag them across the screen and delete them.



## Backlog

Responsivness issue. When the window of document is too small, the notes are jumping outside of the view and resizing is required to grab them.

As the grab button has only 20x20 px of size, the grabbing stops if user moves mouse to quicly and leaves the dragging area.

Not mobile frendly.

No backend functionality which means that whenever user will refresh the page, the notes along with the content will disappear.


## Notes
This is practice project and many features are non existent. The point of the project was to practice the mouse event operations.

The aspect of the file management and styling css file seperation was ignored as this was not the main focus of this project.
